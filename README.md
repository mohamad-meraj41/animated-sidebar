# Animated Sidebar with Smooth Transitions

Welcome to the **Animated Sidebar** project! This project implements a responsive and animated sidebar that opens smoothly with a "slide" effect. When the sidebar is opened, the content of the page fades and blurs slightly to emphasize the sidebar. This sidebar also features a unique "staircase" effect where each link appears one after the other with a slight delay.

## Features

- **Slide-In Sidebar**: The sidebar smoothly slides in from the left side of the screen.
- **Animated Links**: Links appear one after another with a delay, creating a staircase animation effect.
- **Blurred Content**: The main content becomes slightly blurred when the sidebar is open to make the sidebar more prominent.
- **Responsive Design**: The sidebar works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Overlay**: A transparent overlay appears when the sidebar is active, adding to the visual effect.

# How it works
- HTML Structure: The sidebar is implemented using a fixed-position div that slides in and out when activated.

- CSS Transitions: The sidebar and its links are animated using CSS transitions for smooth visual effects.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is used to toggle the sidebar's visibility and handle user interactions like clicking the toggle 

# JavaScript Functions
- toggleSidebar(): This function toggles the active state of the sidebar and shows or hides the sidebar with smooth transitions.

- toggleOverlay(): This function controls the overlay, making it visible when the sidebar is active and hiding it when the sidebar is closed.
